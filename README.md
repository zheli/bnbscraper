# This is a scrapy project to scrape some basic info from AirBnB

It is a simple project to see how [scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) works.

If you want to try it download scrapy and run
`scrape crawl airbnb` you can change the initial query in the `airbnbSpider.py`
to somthing that you might be more interested in than Italy.

For now the spider simply follows the links which it finds on the search page and logs interesting property from the individual listings.
